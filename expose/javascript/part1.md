### Question 1.  
Line 9 will print: "values added: 20"

### Question 2:  
Line 13 will print: "final result: 20"

### Question 3:
Line 9 will print: "values added: 20"

### Question 4:
The code contains an error because the variable 'result' is not in scope. 
The 'result' variable is defined using let inside of an if statement, 
thus it cannot be called outside of the initial if statement it was declared in.

### Question 5: 
The code contains an error because you cannot change the value of a variable
defined as a const. 

### Question 6:
The code contains an error and will never reach line 13. Additionally, if 
it did reach here, another error would occur. This is because const contains
the same scope properties as the let keyword and thus, the variable 
'result' is not in scope/defined outside of the if statement.
